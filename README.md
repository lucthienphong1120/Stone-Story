The game takes elements from various genres and repackages them into a wholly unique experience. One of Stone Story’s defining mechanics is that you have no direct control of the player character, as an A.I. does all the exploring, combat and looting. That doesn’t mean this is an idle game. Potions and special abilities are maximized by good timing. Boss fights are intense, requiring quick item swaps if the boss changes patterns.
